# FDNY_analysis
The New York City Fire Department keeps a log of detailed information on incidents handled by FDNY units. In this challenge I worked on a dataset that contains a record of incidents handled by FDNY units from 2013-2019. The dataset was downloaded from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/tm6d-hbzd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD.
