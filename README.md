# FDNY_analysis
The New York City Fire Department keeps a log of detailed information on incidents handled by FDNY units. In this challenge I worked on a dataset that contains a record of incidents handled by FDNY units from 2013-2019. Please find the jupyter notebook and python script containing computations. Thanks!

The dataset was downloaded from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/tm6dhbzd/rows.csvaccessType=DOWNLOAD.
